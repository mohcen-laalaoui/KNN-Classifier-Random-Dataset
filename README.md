# K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier on Random Dataset

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm on a randomly generated dataset. The notebook covers steps from dataset creation to training and evaluating a KNN classifier, providing an understanding of how KNN works and how it can be applied to simple classification tasks.

### Key Features:
- **Dataset Generation**: Creating a random dataset with labeled data points.
- **KNN Classifier**: Using the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm for classification.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the model using accuracy and other performance metrics.
- **Visualization**: Visualizing decision boundaries and the classification process.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
